Latest features:
- Should reset when 32 blocks away from the spawn position.
- Becomes awake when a player is within 6 blocks.
- Generates 5% of health when dormant. (Maybe hard to see for you, I made the boss-bar invisible when a Golem is dormant)
- Shoots fireballs.
- Melees.

When enraged:
- Double fireball firing speed.
- Double damage intake.

All Golems:
+ Go dormant when you die and return to the tower top but instead of fully healing, they slowly regenerate health
+ the golems when freed from the monolith can chase the player at a max range of 2 chunks, otherwise they teleport back
+ if they go dormant when a player dies, then you will need to go within a 6 blocks or less radius to reawaken it

Apocalypse stomp

+ Fireballs explode in the air without hitting a block after a certain time like Anti-Air

========================================================================

Sky golem legs do not move and she uses vex animations [weapon hand raises when she charges]
-holds a sword in hand
Ocean golem tail doesn't need an animation [but a light waving would be fine]
-holds a trident in hand 
[weapons are twice the size of player handheld items]

-Movement: Vex
-circling the player at a distance 
-flying towards the player but not into
Secondary Movement:
-charges towards and into the player at 2x her current speed
-----------------------------------------------------
Sky Golem default speed is 2x a vex [3x] when charging
-----------------------------------------------------
when below 1/4 hp, her speed increased to 3x a vex with 4x charging

Minions
-every 1/4 hp lost she summons 7-10 sky minions
-these minions are as weak as vex but do 30% more damage 
-they are player sized with wings
-Vex AI makes them circle and charge, nothing special
--------------------------------------------------------
IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT HAVE IT SO THEY OCCASIONALLY GROUP TOGETHER BEFORE DISPERSING OUT TO CHARGE
------------------------------------
shoots a dragons breath fireball [this can linger in air] 
[also it's purple, as if she was consuming the end eye to produce such fire]

========================================================================

Core golem:
"I've decided to do a small remodel of the core god to make him more interesting"
- he will take damage from anything instead of just pickaxes.
- but I'm giving him an extra set of arms
- and a new ability when he reaches 1/3 health, he raises into the air and sprouts 4 more arms. Those arms shoots fireballs alongside his head in stage 2

the ocean/sky golem should return to their summon point if you die, if not they persist with a follow range of 2 chunks
all the others would have a 2 chunk range as well, returning to their summon point when you die

Golem HP should slowly return as well rather than insta-refill

Attacks:
-Melee Punch
-Fireball
-Apocalypse stomp that breaks obsidian
-every 5 fireballs he shoots, he cracks [cracked_core.png]
---------------------------------------------
if hit during this phase, deal double damage
---------------------------------------------
-if you don't hit him within 5 seconds, he stop moving [monolith implode sound plays]
-this then blasts out energy [AoE explosion all around him [TNT damage]]
-when below 1/3 hp, he will begin to rise up 8 blocks into the air
-he then raises, his arms go from his sides to a 'T' pose before changing models
-----------------------------------
switches to [core_god_phase_2] model & texture 
-----------------------------------
-golem flies around like a vex
-occasionally charging towards and past the player in a downwards swoop
-charges downwards or up towards the player in a shallow 'U' shape
-summons 6 fireballs above each of its hands 
-the 6 fireballs form a ring before randomly firing them off
